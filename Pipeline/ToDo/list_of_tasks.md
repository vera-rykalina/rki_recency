# List of tasks and ideas to be tested

- Try fresh installation of phyloscanerR to see if it works:
devtools::install on the phyloscannerR directory

- Try to install R, phyloscannerR and all its dependencies, using conda

- Distribute the scripts and tool's scripts as intended by shiver & phyloscanner & HIV-PhyloTSI (now all scripts are merged within bin)

- Clarify if --x-iqtree is an option now

- Create custom HIV_DistanceNormalisationOverGenome.csv and compare with an available file
